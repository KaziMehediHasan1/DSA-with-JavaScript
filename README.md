# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (JavaScript)

Welcome to my DSA laboratory! 🧪 This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. I am currently following the **Codevolution (DSA with JavaScript)** curriculum to build a rock-solid foundation in computer science fundamentals.

## 🎯 Goal
My objective is to move beyond just "making code work" to writing **highly optimized, scalable, and efficient software.**

## 🛠️ Why JavaScript?
Implementing DSA in JavaScript provides unique challenges and insights:
* **Memory Management:** Understanding how the V8 engine handles objects and arrays.
* **Optimization:** Learning when to use built-in methods vs. manual loops for better performance.
* **Modern Syntax:** Leveraging ES6+ features like Classes and Arrow functions.

## 📈 Big O Performance Table

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Binary Search | $O(\log n)$ | $O(1)$ |
| Merge Sort | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Quick Sort | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(\log n)$ |
| Bubble Sort | $O(n^2)$ | $O(1)$ |

## 📂 Project Structure
Each file in this repo is structured for maximum readability:

1. **The Problem:** Description of the challenge.
2. **The Logic:** Explanation of the approach.
3. **The Implementation:** Clean, commented JS code.
4. **Complexity Analysis:** Explicit Time and Space complexity notes.

```javascript
// Example Structure
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  // Logic here...
}
// Time: O(log n) | Space: O(1)
